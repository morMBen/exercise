"use strict";

//! Rules of the this keyword
//* every function gets the this keyword
//* It points to the "owner" of the function in whixh the this keyword is used
//* This keyword is NOT static. It depends on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned when the function is actually called.

//! Function calls
//* methods in objects: this keyword points to the object which the method is called
//Owner: is the object who called the method
//*Normal functions: window object,strict-mode: undefined
//* arrow functions: do not get their own this keyword. Gets the this from lexically , pointing up.
//Owner: the parent scope
//* event listeners: this keyword will point to the DOM element that the handler is attached to
//Owner: Element that called the event listener

// global scope
// console.log(this);

//regular function

const calcAge = function (birthYear) {
  console.log(this);
  console.log(2037 - birthYear);
};
// calcAge(1980);

//arrow function

const calcAgeArrow = (birthYear) => {
  console.log(this);
  console.log(2037 - birthYear);
};
// calcAgeArrow(1990);

//* normal functions as a method
const timmy = {
  year: 1990,
  calcAge: function () {
    console.log(this);
    // console.log(2037 - this.year);
  },
};
// timmy.calcAge();

const johnny = {
  year: 2000,
};
//*method borrowing
johnny.calcAge = timmy.calcAge;
//now the this keyword points to johnny because im calling the method with johnny who is the owner
// johnny.calcAge();
// console.log(johnny);
//!Always points to the object who calls the method. It is dynamic and not static

const f = timmy.calcAge;
// f();
//now when I cal the f() it is a normal function there is no owner

// var firstName = "Benjamin"; is window.firstName

//*arrow functions and normal functions inside a object
const ben = {
  firstName: "ben",
  year: 1995,
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this);
    console.log(this.firstName);
  },
};
//*arrow functions do not get their own this keyword it looks at its parent scope which is window in this example

// ben.greet();

//normal functions in methods

const ben2 = {
  firstName: "ben",
  year: 1995,
  greet: function () {
    console.log(this);
    console.log(this.firstName);
  },
};
// ben2.greet();
//!Its always best practice if you have a method do them in a regular function not arrow function

const john = {
  year: 1970,
  calcAge: function () {
    console.log(this);
    console.log(2037 - this.year);
    const self = this;
    //get a reference to this from the calcAge method
    const isOld = function () {
      //now I can use the reference here in my normal function
      console.log(self.year > 1960);
      console.log(self);
    };
    isOld();
  },
};

john.calcAge();

const john2 = {
  year: 1970,
  calcAge: function () {
    console.log(this);
    console.log(2037 - this.year);
    const isOld = () => {
      //arrow functions will look at its parent scope which is the calcAge method so this will be pointing to the object
      console.log(this.year > 1960);
      console.log(this);
    };
    isOld();
  },
};
john.calcAge();

//* Event listeners

document.querySelector("h1").addEventListener("click", function () {
  //normal functions, the this will get binded to who ever called then. Arrow functions the this keyword does not get binding to anything so it will get this from the global object which points to the window
  console.log(this);
});
